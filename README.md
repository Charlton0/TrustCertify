By integrating technologies like multisignature verification mechanism and blockchain, the system ensures the authenticity, accuracy, and immutability of certificates. Institutions can issue tamper-proof digital certificates, while verifiers can instantly validate them using unique identifiers. This solution eliminates manual verification challenges, combats fraud, and fosters trust among stakeholders.

## Key Features

### Immutability
Certificates stored on blockchain can not be altered or tampered with ensuring their authenticity and integrity.
### Decentralisation
The system eliminates the need for a central authority to verify certificates.
### Transparancy
All certificates are publicly verifiable but without exposing sensitive personal information as it uses unique IDs for each certificate issued
### Scalability
The system is very scalable as it supports a growing number of certificates as more institutions adopt it.
### Revocation
Institutions can revoke certificates if need be e.g. in case of fraud and the blockchain will record the revocation transparently.
### Multisignature Verification mechanism
The system incorporates a robust multisignature verification process, requiring approvals from multiple authorized parties before a certificate is considered valid for issuance or before a certificate is revoked.
